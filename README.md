# Filecrypt
This Python script allows to **encrypt and decrypt files present in the current folder of the script**. The program is based on the `cryptography` module and in particular its Fernet class allowing symmetric encryption using the 128-bit AES algorithm.

## encrypt command
Encrypts a file present in the current folder using three different methods :
1. By generating a random filekey in the current folder
2. By using a valid filekey already present in the current folder
3. By using a password and optionally a salt value

These three methods are mutually exclusive, but **must** include the name of the file to be encrypted and the `overwrite` option.

### overwrite option
- `-ow` / `--overwrite` : the file will be overwritten by its encrypted version (*in the case of an image file for example, it will therefore become corrupted*)
- `-c` / `--copy` : The plaintext file will be copied before being overwritten by its encrypted version.

### Examples
#### **Method 1** : By generating a random filekey in the current folder
Let's suppose we want to encrypt a file named `psw.txt` by overwriting it :

`python filecrypt.py encrypt psw.txt -ow`

Same thing, but first copy the file to the current folder before encrypting it.

`python filecrypt.py encrypt psw.txt -c`

A filekey named `filekey.key` will be created in the current folder.

> **Note**: The filekey **doesn't contain the ciphertext but only the secret key**. It should be kept in a safe place.

#### **Method 2** : By using a filekey already present in the current folder
The `-f`/`--filekey` option lets us specify the filekey to be used

`python filecrypt.py encrypt psw.txt -f filekey.key -ow`

#### **Method 3** : By using a password and optionally a salt value

Fernet can also generate keys from : 
- a password : `-p` / `--password`
- and a salt value : `-s` / `--salt`

> **What's a "salt"** ? : Imagine you want to preserve a dish with a unique taste. To make it inimitable, you can add a pinch of specific salt to your recipe. This salt, unique to your dish, will make it impossible for anyone else to reproduce exactly the same taste using the same basic ingredients. In cryptography, the “salt” plays a similar role. It's a random string of characters added to a password before it's hashed. This hash, i.e. the transformation of the password into a fixed-length string of characters, is used to store the password securely.

When no salt value is entered, the script will automatically generate one in the form of 16 random bytes (generated by `os.urandom()`). This value will be encoded in base64 urlsafe so that it can be easily displayed to the user and kept in a safe place.

> **Caution**: With identical passwords, two encrypted files cannot be decrypted if they have different salt values. That's why it's crutial to keep both the password AND the salt in a safe place. If the file is encrypted again without specifying a salt value, a new one will be randomly generated, making the old one obsolete. 

Let's say we have an image named `image.jpg` in the current folder and we want to encrypt it with the password: `notastrongpsw` (*a password whose only virtue is honesty*): 

`python filecrypt.py encrypt image.jpg -p notastrongpsw -ow`

Since no salt has been entered, the value will be generated automatically. The file has been encrypted inplace and the random generated salt is displayed on the terminal :

```
- - - - SALT (KEEP IT SAFE) - - - - -
zhWYYqNubPOb0aH_AAGV3Q==
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
```
When the time comes to decrypt the file, the password AND this salt will be required.

Now let's say we want to encrypt the same file, but this time with a salt we already own. 

`python filecrypt.py encrypt image.jpg -p notastrongpsw -s zhWYYqNubPOb0aH_AAGV3Q== -ow`

> **Note** : It is recommended to use salt values generated directly from the script to ensure compliance with standardization.

## decrypt command
Decrypts a file present in the current folder using two different methods :
1. By using a filekey present in the current folder
2. By using a known password and a salt

### Examples
#### **Method 1** : By using a filekey present in the current folder

Decryption of a file named `psw.txt` using a filkey named `filekey.key` present in the current folder :

`python filecrypt.py decrypt psw.txt filekey.key`

#### **Method 2** : By using a password and a salt
This method is used to decrypt a file that has been encrypted using a password and a salt value known to the user.

Here we decrypt the file `image.jpg`, encrypted in our example in the 'encrypt command' section with the password `notastrongpsw` and the salt `zhWYYqNubPOb0aH_AAGV3Q==` :

`python filecrypt.py decrypt image.jpg -p notastrongpsw -s zhWYYqNubPOb0aH_AAGV3Q==`

> **Note**: Unlike the `encrypt` command, where the `--salt` option was optional for encrypting with a password, here, the `--password` AND `--salt` options must both be set.

## install command
Installs the `cryptography` module and its dependencies via the pip command

### Example
`python filecrypt.py install`

All necessary dependencies will be installed via pip

## read command
Displays the Base64 code present in a filekey

### Example
`python filecrypt.py read filekey.key`

Display example:

`MWpYeBrqiaVVZIOZrJFntiF2K0_ZYZZ2eCxBQ1_CuAI=`

## create command
Creates a filekey in the current folder by providing the desired name and the key (*base64 urlsafe*). 

**Practical example**: after encrypting a file, for security reasons we don't want to keep the filekey on the computer, so we can extract its key using the `read` command, copy/paste it somewhere else (or even copy it onto paper) and delete the filekey. When we want to decrypt this file, the filekey can be recreated using the `create` command.

### Example
Create a file named secretkey with its key :

`python filecrypt.py create secretkey ejK4-SDwj4CFuQ28L28KMjaNVgg-BH1l6FIF3dLsgfk=`

The command creates a filekey in the current folder, named secret.key, with the supplied key. 

## Some technical details
### What's Fernet ?
Fernet (from `cryptography` module) is an implementation of the AES algorithm using a 128-bit key. Fernet offers an abstraction that allows developers to encrypt and decrypt data without having to worry about the complexities of implementing AES and other security mechanisms.

### What level of security?
* **AES** : Data is encrypted using AES (**A**dvanced **E**ncryption **S**tandard), a symmetrical encryption algorithm that encrypts data in blocks of a fixed size.


* **128-bits** : This is the size of the secret key. It offers a high level of security, making brute-force attacks extremely difficult ($2^{128}$ possible combinations).


* **CBC mode** : The **C**ipher **B**lock **C**haining links the encryption of each block to the previous one. Each block of plaintext data is XOR'd with the preceding encrypted block before being encrypted. So if a bit is modified in the ciphertext, this will affect not only the decryption of this block, but also of all subsequent blocks.


* **Initialisation Vector (IV)** : Since the first block has no precedent, it's subjected to a random initialization vector: a series of randomly generated bits of the same size as the block, which acts as the “previous block”. This randomness masks repetitions in the code, even if the plain text begins with the same data in several sessions.


* **Crypto secure RNG** : The secret key and the initialisation vector are randomly generated using `os.urandom()`, which relies on the operating system's entropy (*harware interupts, network data, running processes...*) to make generation as unpredictable as possible (CSPRNG).


* **Padding PKCS7** : This technique ensures that the data to be encrypted always occupies an integer number of blocks, as required by the AES algorithm. To do this, the function adds padding bytes to the end of the plaintext data if it isn't a multiple of the desired block size.


* **HMAC** : **H**ash-based **M**essage **A**uthentication **C**ode is a cryptographic function used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message, it's calculated on the basis of the encrypted data. **If the integrity of the encrypted file is compromised, it becomes impossible to decrypt it**.


* **SHA-256** : A cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit hash value. It's used to generate the **M**essage **A**uthentication **C**ode.
